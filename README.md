### Project Description
Ensuring safety of humans in critical situations,emergencies using a website

### The Problem statement
People‚Äôs safety is a critical concern, especially in
situations where immediate assistance is required.
Traditional methods of seeking help, such as calling
the police or informing family members, may be
inefficient or impossible in emergencies

### The Solution
This project aims to develop a website for human safety application that allows users to register with their
personal details (name, address, phone number, photo, etc.) and provide real-time live location updates.
In case of trouble, the app will automatically trigger an SOS alert to the nearest police station, sharing the
user
s live location and distress signal to ensure timely assistance.
The solution bridges the gap between technology and safety by offering a reliable, accessible, and userfriendly platform for quick response during emergencies.
